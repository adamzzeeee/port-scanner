Here's a simple README file for your port scanner project. You can create a README.md file and paste the following content:
Port Scanner

A simple Python-based tool to scan open ports on a target machine, useful for penetration testing and network analysis.
Features

    Scans a range of ports on a target machine to identify open ports.
    Displays the status of each port (OPEN or CLOSED).
    Allows users to specify the range of ports to scan.
    Works with any IP address or hostname.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    No external libraries required (uses Python's built-in socket library).

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/adamzzeeee/port-scanner.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd port-scanner

Run the script:

    python port_scanner.py

Usage

    Run the script with Python:

    python port_scanner.py

    When prompted, enter the following:
        Target Host: IP address or hostname of the machine you want to scan (e.g., 192.168.1.1 or example.com).
        Start Port: The starting port number for the scan (e.g., 20).
        End Port: The ending port number for the scan (e.g., 80).

    The script will display open ports on the target machine within the specified range.
